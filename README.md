### EXPLAINABLE AI FOR WEATHER-DRIVEN CROP STRESS ALERTS: PREDICTING ACTIONABLE RISK INDICES TO MITIGATE TOMORROW'S AGRICULTURAL LOSSES

This code is developed in Google Colab and focuses on implementing Explainable AI (XAI) for analyzing weather-related crop stress factors. The targeted stress parameters include:

- Pollination Risk

- Drought Shock

- Disease Risk

- Wind Damage Index

- Thermal Shock

To model these factors, the following machine learning and deep learning models are utilized:

- XGBoost

- Random Forest

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Model explainability is achieved using:

- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

#### Workflow Steps

The code performs a complete pipeline for predictive modeling, including:

- Loading data from source

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data cleaning and outlier detection

- Data transformation and scaling

- Categorical encoding

- Feature engineering

- Model implementation (XGBoost, RF, LSTM)

- XAI-based interpretation using SHAP and LIME

- Model evaluation and comparison
